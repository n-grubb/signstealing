BACKEND TASKS
  - Write api endpoints for: 
    - getPlayers (return the top 300) - how do we classify top 300?
    - getPlayerStats
    - getTeams
    - getProjections
  - Setup serverless architecture 
  - Move local MongoDB to Atlas
  - Crawl and update script for STEAMER Projections
  - Crawl script for ADP, may be able to use the above script for both
  - Might want to update db architecture for performance, the following could come from 1 table:

  rk | player | team | r | rbi | hr | sb | obp | avg | w | svhd | k | era | whip

Pete Alonso: 19251 -- ids dont match across tables, must use first-last to match players
