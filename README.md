# signstealing
A fantasy baseball SPA providing analysis and rankings tools. This version contains a lot of crunch-time code as I wanted to build this for use within my own fantasy baseball league (and I did!). Built with Vue3 and MongoDB Realm.  

A rewrite for this application in React and Next is currently under development. Follow the progress here [here](https://github.com/n-grubb/signstealing).
